# Weather Data Visualizer (Mini Project)

This is my mini project for the subject **Programming for Problem Solving using Python**.  
In this project, I analysed **Delhi weather data** using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Load a real weather CSV file  
- Clean the data (remove missing values, convert date)  
- Do basic statistics like mean, min, max  
- Make graphs for temperature, rainfall and humidity  
- Save cleaned data and create a small report  

---

## 📁 Dataset Used
I used a dataset called **delhi_weather.csv**.  
It has these columns:

- date  
- mintemp  
- maxtemp  
- humidity  
- rainfall  

I converted them into proper format in the code.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- VS Code  

---

## 📊 Visualizations Made
The program creates the following graphs:

- Temperature Line Chart  
- Monthly Rainfall Bar Chart  
- Humidity vs Temperature Scatter Plot  
- Combined Plot (Temperature + Rainfall)

All graphs are saved in the **visualizations** folder.

## 📂 Files in This Project
- `weather_visualizer.py` → the main Python program  
- `delhi_weather.csv` → original dataset  
- `cleaned_weather_data.csv` → cleaned output data  
- `weather_analysis_report.md` → auto-generated report  
- `README.md` → you are reading it  
- `visualizations/` → folder with PNG graph images  

---

## ▶ How to Run
1. Install Python  
2. Install required libraries:  
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Put the CSV file in the same folder  
4. Run the program  
   ```
   python weather_visualizer.py
   ```
5. Check the output files and graphs

## ✅ Conclusion
This mini project helped me understand:
- how to work with real data  
- how to clean and analyse datasets  
- how to create graphs using Python  
- how to generate reports automatically  

It was a good learning experience for me as a first-semester student.
